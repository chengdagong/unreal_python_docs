# unreal.PoseDriverTarget

```python
class unreal.PoseDriverTarget
```


**Bases:** ``StructBase``


Information about each target in the PoseDriver

**C++ Source:**

- **Module**: AnimGraphRuntime

- **File**: AnimNode\_PoseDriver.h


**Editor Properties:** (see get\_editor\_property/set\_editor\_property)

- `apply_custom_curve` (bool): [Read-Write] If we should apply a custom curve mapping to how this target activates

- `bone_transforms` (Array[PoseDriverTransform]): [Read-Write] Translation of this target

- `custom_curve` (RichCurve): [Read-Write] Custom curve mapping to apply if bApplyCustomCurve is true

- `distance_method` (RBFDistanceMethod): [Read-Write] Override for the distance method to use for each target

- `driven_name` (Name): [Read-Write] Name of item to drive - depends on DriveOutput setting.
If DriveOutput is DrivePoses, this should be the name of a pose in the assigned PoseAsset
If DriveOutput is DriveCurves, this is the name of the curve (morph target, material param etc) to drive

- `function_type` (RBFFunctionType): [Read-Write] Override for the function method to use for each target

- `is_hidden` (bool): [Read-Write] If we should hide this pose from the UI

- `target_rotation` (Rotator): [Read-Write] Rotation of this target

- `target_scale` (float): [Read-Write] Scale applied to this target’s function - a larger value will activate this target sooner
