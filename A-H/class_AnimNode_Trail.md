**Bases:** ``AnimNode_SkeletalControlBase``


Trail Controller

**C++ Source:**

- **Module**: AnimGraphRuntime

- **File**: AnimNode\_Trail.h


**Editor Properties:** (see get\_editor\_property/set\_editor\_property)

- `actor_space_fake_vel` (bool): [Read-Write] Whether ‘fake’ velocity should be applied in actor or world space.

- `alpha` (float): [Read-Write] Current strength of the skeletal control

- `alpha_bool_blend` (InputAlphaBoolBlend): [Read-Write]

- `alpha_bool_enabled` (bool): [Read-Write]

- `alpha_curve_name` (Name): [Read-Write]

- `alpha_input_type` (AnimAlphaInputType): [Read-Write]

- `alpha_scale_bias` (InputScaleBias): [Read-Write]

- `alpha_scale_bias_clamp` (InputScaleBiasClamp): [Read-Write]

- `base_joint` (BoneReference): [Read-Write] Base Joint to calculate velocity from. If none, it will use Component’s World Transform. .

- `chain_bone_axis` (AxisType): [Read-Write] Axis of the bones to point along trail.

- `chain_length` (int32): [Read-Write] Number of bones above the active one in the hierarchy to modify. ChainLength should be at least 2.

- `component_pose` (ComponentSpacePoseLink): [Read-Write] Input link

- `debug_life_time` (float): [Read-Write] Debug Life Time

- `enable_debug` (bool): [Read-Write] Enable Debug in the PIE. This doesn’t work in game

- `fake_velocity` (Vector): [Read-Write] ‘Fake’ velocity applied to bones.

- `invert_chain_bone_axis` (bool): [Read-Write] Invert the direction specified in ChainBoneAxis.

- `last_bone_rotation_anim_alpha_blend` (float): [Read-Write] How to set last bone rotation. It copies from previous joint if alpha is 0.f, or 1.f will use animated pose

- This alpha dictates the blend between parent joint and animated pose, and how much you’d like to use animated pose for


- `limit_rotation` (bool): [Read-Write] Limit the amount that a bone can stretch from its ref-pose length.

- `limit_stretch` (bool): [Read-Write] Limit the amount that a bone can stretch from its ref-pose length.

- `lod_threshold` (int32): [Read-Write] \* Max LOD that this node is allowed to run
\\* For example if you have LODThreshold to be 2, it will run until LOD 2 (based on 0 index)
\\* when the component LOD becomes 3, it will stop update/evaluate
\\* currently transition would be issue and that has to be re-visited

- `max_delta_time` (float): [Read-Write] To avoid hitches causing stretch of trail, you can use MaxDeltaTime to clamp the long delta time. If you want 30 fps to set it to 0.03333f ( = 1/30 ).

- `planar_limits` (Array[AnimPhysPlanarLimit]): [Read-Write] List of available planar limits for this node

- `relaxation_speed_scale` (float): [Read-Write]

- `relaxation_speed_scale_input_processor` (InputScaleBiasClamp): [Read-Write]

- `reorient_parent_to_child` (bool): [Read-Write] Fix up rotation to face child for the parent

- `rotation_limits` (Array[RotationLimit]): [Read-Write]

- `rotation_offsets` (Array[Vector]): [Read-Write]

- `show_base_motion` (bool): [Read-Write] Show Base Motion

- `show_limit` (bool): [Read-Write] Show Planar Limits \*

- `show_trail_location` (bool): [Read-Write] Show Trail Location \*

- `stretch_limit` (float): [Read-Write] If bLimitStretch is true, this indicates how long a bone can stretch beyond its length in the ref-pose.

- `trail_bone` (BoneReference): [Read-Write] Reference to the active bone in the hierarchy to modify.

- `trail_relaxation_speed` (RuntimeFloatCurve): [Read-Write] How quickly we ‘relax’ the bones to their animated positions. Time 0 will map to top root joint, time 1 will map to the bottom joint.

- `use_planar_limit` (bool): [Read-Write] Whether to evaluate planar limits
