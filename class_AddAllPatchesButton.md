# unreal.AddAllPatchesButton

```python
class unreal.AddAllPatchesButton
```


**Bases:** ``StructBase``


Empty struct to have it customized in DetailsView to display a button on
the DMX Take Recorder properties. This is a required hack to customize the
properties in the TakeRecorder DetailsView because it has a customization
that overrides any class customization. So we need to tackle individual
property types instead.

**C++ Source:**

- **Plugin**: DMXEngine

- **Module**: DMXEditor

- **File**: TakeRecorderDMXLibrarySource.h
